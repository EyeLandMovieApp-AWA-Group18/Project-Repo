# Client Project Directory

This is the client-side project for the application, built with React.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
This will run all the tests and display results in the terminal.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**  
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.  
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.  
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.  
At this point, you're on your own. You don't have to ever use `eject`, but if you need customizations, it is available.

# Server Project Directory

This is the server-side project for the application, built with Node.js and Express.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run devStart`

Runs the server in development mode with `nodemon`.  
The server will start and automatically restart when code changes are made.
